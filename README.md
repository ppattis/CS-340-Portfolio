## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The number one way to write programs that are maintainable and readable is comment, comment, and comment some more.  In addition to commenting the code religiously, keeping your coding style standard throughout the entire program or module also helps with the maintainability.  The CRUD module would probabaly require some additional work to make it more usable as it is currently custom written for the class projects it was required for, but it could be super useful for future needs where Mongo DB access is required with a Python program.
    
    
## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching problems as a Computer Scientist the first thing I do is analyze the problem and try to identify the base probelems.  By this I mean if the problem is to add a bunch of numbers then the base problem is to add two numbers.  By breaking the problem into base problems, then the overall problem just becomes repeating the base problems numerous time either repeatedly or iteratively.
    
    
## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists make lives easier.  In addition to the entertainment that computer scientists provide with computer games we also write programs that at the heart of it make complicated tasks easier.  The tasks that the Grazioso Salvare dashboard accomplished was something that could just as easily be accomplished by hand, however the dashboard automated much of the tasking.
